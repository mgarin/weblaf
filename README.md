3. Various extended components - collapsible panes, checkbox lists and others
4. Various managers to simply control application settings, language, tooltips, hotkeys and other aspects
5. Various utility classes which simplify Swing components usage
6. Various Swing extensions that allows animated transitions, effects and other features

Building
----------
To build various WebLaF artifacts you will need [Java 1.6 update 30 (or later)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [Apache ANT] (http://ant.apache.org/).<br>
Simply run `ant` command within the "build" library folder to build all artifacts at once.

Here is a full list of usable ANT targets in WebLaF build script:

1. **build.artifacts** - default target, builds all artifacts at once
2. **build.sources.zip** - builds Sources.zip and saves it into artifacts folder
3. **build.weblaf.jar** - builds WebLookAndFeel.jar and saves it into artifacts folder
4. **build.npe.jar** - builds NinePatchEditor.jar and saves it into artifacts folder
5. **build.weblaf.demo.jar** - builds WebLookAndFeel_demo.jar and saves it into artifacts folder
6. **build.javadoc** - creates library zipped and unzipped JavaDoc versions inside artifacts folder
7. **run.npe** - build and run NinePatchEditor.jar (Nine-Patch Editor application)
8. **run.weblaf** - build and run WebLookAndFeel.jar (library information dialog)
9. **run.weblaf.demo** - build and run WebLookAndFeel_demo.jar (library demo application)


Usage
----------
To install Web L&F you can simply use this line of code:

    WebLookAndFeel.install ();
    
You can also use one of the old ways to set L&F:

    UIManager.setLookAndFeel ( new WebLookAndFeel () );
    // or 
    UIManager.setLookAndFeel ( "com.alee.laf.WebLookAndFeel" );
    // or 
    UIManager.setLookAndFeel ( WebLookAndFeel.class.getCanonicalName () );


Feedback
----------
I would really appreciate if you will post any found bugs in [issues section](https://github.com/mgarin/weblaf/issues) here, on GitHub.<br>
You can also post them on the library [official site forum](http://weblookandfeel.com/forum/), but that would require registration.<br> 
And, as always, you can send any feedback directly to my email: [mgarin@alee.com](mailto:mgarin@alee.com)
