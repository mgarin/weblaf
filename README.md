Building
----------
To build various WebLaF artifacts you will need [Java 1.6 update 20 (or later)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [Apache ANT] (http://ant.apache.org/).<br>
Simply run `ant` command within the "build" library folder to build all artifacts at once.

Here is a full list of usable ANT targets in WebLaF build script:

1. **build.artifacts** - default target, builds all artifacts at once
2. **build.sources.zip** - builds Sources.zip and saves it into artifacts folder
3. **build.weblaf.jar** - builds WebLookAndFeel.jar and saves it into artifacts folder
4. **build.npe.jar** - builds NinePatchEditor.jar and saves it into artifacts folder
5. **build.weblaf.demo.jar** - builds WebLookAndFeel_demo.jar and saves it into artifacts folder
6. **build.javadoc** - creates library zipped and unzipped JavaDoc versions inside artifacts folder
7. **run.npe** - build and run NinePatchEditor.jar (Nine-Patch Editor application)
8. **run.weblaf** - build and run WebLookAndFeel.jar (library information dialog)
9. **run.weblaf.demo** - build and run WebLookAndFeel_demo.jar (library demo application)


Usage
----------
To install Web L&F you can simply use this line of code:

    WebLookAndFeel.install ();
    
You can also use one of the old ways to set L&F:

    UIManager.setLookAndFeel ( new WebLookAndFeel () );
    // or 
    UIManager.setLookAndFeel ( "com.alee.laf.WebLookAndFeel" );
    // or 
    UIManager.setLookAndFeel ( WebLookAndFeel.class.getCanonicalName () );


Feedback
----------
I would really appreciate if you will post any found bugs in [issues section](https://github.com/mgarin/weblaf/issues) here, on GitHub.<br>
You can also post them on the library [official site forum](http://weblookandfeel.com/forum/), but that would require registration.<br> 
And, as always, you can send any feedback directly to my email: [mgarin@alee.com](mailto:mgarin@alee.com)
