 * This listener allows you to quickly attach one window to another window. This means that this window will always follow the other one
 * when it moves on the screen. Though the other window in this link will not follow this window as it moves.
 * <p/>
 * Example usage:
 * <p/>
 * <code>new WindowFollowListener ( dialog, mainWindow );</code>
 * <p/>
 * This is enough to link the child dialog movement with the mainWindow movement.
